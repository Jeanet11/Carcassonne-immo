================

Educational project for testing 

Carcassonne-immo is a real-estate agency which needs a website for both its employees and its clients.

For the visitors, there will be 2 pages : one that displays all the adverts( title, number of rooms and price), witch can be filtered by name and/or categories and another that shows the details of a chosen add with a picture. 

Employees should be able to administrate their adverts and clients eg. creating new adverts, clients(people who sell or rent their houses or appartments) edit or delete them thanks to administration backend.
